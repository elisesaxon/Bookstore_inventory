# Bookstore_inventory
Final project for WWU Java Programming class (CSCI145)

This project was excellent practice, not only creating and using queues in Java, 
but also with object-oriented programming. This program implements various 
classes which are used as objects in the main code for better organization 
in the program. 
The program intakes a text file of books and their data, then stores that data 
and works with it to create a book inventory for a bookstore.
